            <p>But I still believe, in this world
                "Everything happens for a reason."
                A single "lesson" in my life, what kind of lesson is that?
                I don't think I'll ever read it again.

             <p>Yes, fear has two meanings: forget everything and run, or face everything and rise. You should have the courage to choose either of them. This is all about the video; please do watch until the end. Especially, don't miss out on the poetry in the middle of the video and, of course, the funny ending.
